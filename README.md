### Hello there, beautiful person ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™‚

#### These days we are all busy with things we need to do.<br/>So, in the spirit of delightfulness mixed with errie utopia vibes,<br/>please take a minute to enjoy a rhyme I prompted with [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) about the things I do!

***
```
In the realm of code, I find delight,
As a software engineer, my passion takes flight.

TDD, my trusty guide, ensures precision,
Testing each line, with unwavering decision.

React and RTL, a duo in sync, you see,
Crafting interfaces, as smooth as can be.

With Cypress as my destination, I strive for perfection,
End-to-end testing, guarding my code's protection.

SOLID principles, my foundation firm and strong,
Building code with structure, where bugs don't belong.

OOP's inheritance, polymorphism, and more,
Abstraction and encapsulation, I adore.

C# joins the party, full stack with pride,
Creating robust solutions, unwavering stride.

So let's embark on this coding venture, hand in hand,
With all these tools, our journey will be grand!
